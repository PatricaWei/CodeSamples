This is a compilation of all the projects I'm most proud of. 

C++:
These samples are from my coursework for CS2A: Object Oriented Programming in C++, which I took at Foothill College January 2017 - March 2017.
1) SortingStudents.cpp: Allows the client to create an array of Student objects, and sorts the objects by last name, first name, and number of points. Also provides the median.
2) brew.cpp: Solves a counting problem (with a few exception cases) provided by my instructor using a 2D array. File contains full specs.

JavaScript:
I do not consider myself very strong in JavaScript, but I have included a portion of my code written for the camera function of Bookbulb, and app I created with my friend that allows students to ask homework questions. I worked on this in Spring 2016.
File included: camera.js

Python:
This was one of the assignments I did when taking edx.org's Introduction to Computer Science and Programming using Python. It decodes an encrypted message. 

Java:
Dice statistics is a project I worked on for the first programming class I took, Advanced Programming in Java. It simulates the roll of multiple die and find different statistics on the rolls, such as the frequency of sums. It will also roll multiple die until a certain requirement is met. I worked on this in Summer 2015.
